# pixelPackages3D

[简体中文](README_EN.md) | English

pixelPackages3D is the simplest 3D package generation library, which contains the overall outline data of the model. It is completed based on the spreadsheet of [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/), removes the details of the 3D model and finally uses `stepreduce.exe` to reduce the size of the model.
